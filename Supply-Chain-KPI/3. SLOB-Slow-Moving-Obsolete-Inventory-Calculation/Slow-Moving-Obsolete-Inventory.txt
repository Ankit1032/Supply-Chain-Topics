
The idea is to track this KPI and make sure that you have as little obsolete and slow moving stocks as possible.

SLOB : SLow moving and OBsolete products

% of SLOB = Quality of your inventory.
The lower, the better

#Obsolete inventory( Discontinued inventory)
	-Expired Meds
	-Expired Milk
	-Almost Black-skin banana
	-Summer dresses in Winter season
	-Winter clothes in Summer season
	

#Slow Moving Inventoryp(Excess / Aged/ Leftover inventory)
	- Suppose you need 4 nike shoes to obtain 98% service. But you currently have 24 nike shoes which is excess inventory and its unecessary and also adding holding and logistics costs.
	- If the extra nike shoes doesn't sell, you might have to do a future discount or promotion.
	
#Always make sure to track/monitor %of active stocks and %of obsolete stocks and make sure %obsolete is as low as possible

#To go much deeper, you need to check the lead time , SS and ROP of each product to understand which slow moving stock need to be monitored more or less.

#reduce SLOB and improve service.
