Lead Time Action
1. Track
2. Stabilize
3. Reduce

#Wrong Lead Time impacts
	-Poor Visibility
	-Poor Service
	-Over Stock
	-Extra Costs
	
#Safety Stock and Re-Order point extensively depends upon Lead Time Acuuracy so if Lead Time is impacted, then SS and ROP will also get impacted. If Lead Time increases, Safety stock and re-order point also increases which is bad and adds extra costs.

#Classic lead time mistakes
	- companies not tracking lead time
	- trusting your transporter/supplier contract lead time
	- you only focus on transport lead time
	- you don't consider outliers
	- you only care about the average lead time
	- you want to reduce lead time before stabilizing
	
#Supply chain lead time is the amount of time between a client order and the delivery.

Business to Business/Consumer (Client)

#Types of Lead Time
1. Review Period lead time
2. Production lead time
3. International Transport lead time
4. Warehouse lead time
5. Local Delivery lead time

1. REVIEW PERIOD
-Suppose you have a retail company where you order every Tuesday to the supplier. And you need stocks on Thursday but you will have to wait until Tuesday to order so there's 5 days of lead time already(Waiting period for stocks).

2. IT Confirmation Lead Time
- Suppose you work in FMCG and it takes 4-6 hours to process an order so 4-6 hours also adds up to the lead time.

3. Production Lead Time
a. MTS Lead Time
	-"Products are finishes and stored before receipt of customer's order"
	- So the FGI(Finished goods inventory) will stay in warehouse or DC with no shipping unless it is ordered by a consumer or retail.

	-Make-to-stock (MTS) is a manufacturing strategy in which production planning and production scheduling are based on forecasted product demand.
	The make-to-stock strategy might be used by companies that produce goods that tend to be particularly popular during the holiday season. For instance, a toy manufacturer would forecast consumer demand and produce products accordingly.
	
b. ATO(Assemble-To-Order)
	- "Products is assembled after receipt of a customer's order, using subassembly inventory and semi-finished products".
	
	- So the assembling of the semi-manufactured products add to the lead time.
	
	- ATO stands for "Assemble-to-Order." Assemble-to-Order is a manufacturing strategy in which a company produces a base product or set of components in advance and then assembles them into finished goods only after a customer order is received.
	
	- In an ATO supply chain, the base product or components are often referred to as "pre-manufactured modules" or "semi-finished goods." These modules can be combined in different ways to create a variety of finished products that meet specific customer requirements.

c. MTO(Make-To-Order)
	- "Product is manufactured after receipt of a customer's order"
	
	- So the Production adds up to the lead time.
	
d. ETO (Engineer-TO-Order)
	- "Customer Specifications require unique engineering design, customization, or new purchased materials.
	
4. International Transport Lead Time
a. Waiting Shipping : 
	Suppose the product is ready to ship on thursday but the SEA-FREIGHT SHIP travels once a week(eveny tuesday) , so 5 days is added to the lead time.

b. Customs Clearance : 
	This depends on the type of products you have, also from whr its coming(Consignor) and also whr its going(Consignee).
	
5. Warehouse Lead Time
	- It can be warehouse lead time on your factory or it can be inside your warehouse too.
	
	Lead time of warehouse can be between :
		- Supplier to reception(SIFOT)
		- Reception to Storage
		- Storage to Picking/Packing
		- Picking/Packing to Waiting&Shipping
		- Waiting&Shipping to Customer(DIF/DIFOT)
